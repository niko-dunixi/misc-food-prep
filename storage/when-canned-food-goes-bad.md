## Abstract

WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT!

No matter how much work went into the jar, it's not worth the risk. Don't even feed this food to your livestock (chickens).

## Procedure

When you take the jar, attempt to look for foamy bubbles along the liquid surface. This is a sign that bacteria are releasing $Co^2$.

However, sauces (tomato, apple, anything blending and airating the liquid) will still retain some bubbles, even when "debubbled". These bubbles won't rush to the top, nor will the bubbles foam. These kinds of bubbles are generally safe.

Siphoning can occur when a jar has been canned. You can lose up to 50% of the liquid and still have food be safe.

You can use more vegetables than the recipe calls for, but you must cook all the items in the jar for as long as the longest ingredient's processing time.

EG:
* Ingredient A needs 10 minutes to process
* Ingredient B needs 5 minutes to process
* Ergo, you must process for at least 10 minutes

> Note revisit this specific rule for nuance and safety, it was summarized.
