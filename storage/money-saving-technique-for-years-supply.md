## Notes

Walk perimiter of store and find all the clearance sections. If you can find it on clearance, get it on clearance.

Some shelf-stable items on clearance may not be close to their normal location.

Get as many as you can and then proess immediately.

### Dehydrated Salsa

1. Empty your cups into the trays and spread evenly
2. Dehydrate
3. While this is still warm, remove from silicone tray
   * It is usually easier while warm, but you may have better success chilling in the freezer.
4. Place it in jar.
5. Check Every day for a week
   * if there is clumping and you cannot break it apart by gently shaking you must place back in the dehydrator because there is still excess moisture.

This will keep for about 1 year.

When you want to rehydrate, take as much as desired and place it in a container with water. Adjust the water balance as desired for thickness/runniness. This will take about 15 - 20 minutes to restore.

### Dehydrated Baby Spinach

1. Wash and dry
2. Hand tear and break into slightly smaller pieces
3. Place onto tray distributing evenly
   * If trays are cramping each other, place a mesh or parchment paper on top of a given layer
4. Dehydrate
   * Let this cool down
5. Place in jar and press down because leaves will take up space you can compress.

> When making powder, 1 Tbsp â‰ˆ 1 Cup Fresh
